   - Recommendation: Increase to 80% and add integration tests
   - Impact: Better production stability

2. **Dependency Management** (Priority: Low) 
   - Some deprecated packages (multer@1.4.5, superagent@8.1.2)
   - Node.js version mismatch warning (requires <21, running 22)
   - Recommendation: Update dependencies and Node.js requirements

3. **Database Migrations** (Priority: Medium)
   - Migration strategy needs documentation
   - Recommendation: Implement proper migration scripts for production

4. **Environment Configuration** (Priority: High)
   - Production environment variables need to be documented
   - Recommendation: Create comprehensive deployment guide
